Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter. Next set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away. Afterwards set a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper. Finally, when hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.
